            <h2>Core Banking Concepts</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Money Lending</strong>
                <p>The practice of providing funds to borrowers who repay with interest. Described as "a wonderful concept" that allows "people with money and people without it to benefit from the same money."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Usury</strong>
                <p>Historically defined not as charging excessive interest, but as charging any interest on "non-producing loans." Religious authorities condemned the practice, with biblical references stating those who charge interest "shall not live."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Interest vs. Usury</strong>
                <p>Over time, particularly during the rise of merchant classes, a distinction developed between acceptable "interest" (compensation for opportunity cost) and forbidden "usury" (exploitative rates).</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="institutions" class="section">
            <h2>Banking Institutions and Structures</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Goldsmiths/Early Bankers</strong>
                <p>Originally safekeepers of valuable metals who issued receipts. These receipts began circulating as a form of money, leading goldsmiths to realize they could issue more receipts than gold they held.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Fractional Reserve Banking</strong>
                <p>The practice where banks keep only a fraction of deposits available for withdrawal while lending the rest. Described as "the heart of our whole economic system since the Industrial Revolution and before."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Unit Banking</strong>
                <p>The American system where banks were restricted to a single location. This made U.S. banks uniquely vulnerable to regional economic downturns since they couldn't diversify geographically.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Central Banks</strong>
                <p>Institutions like the Federal Reserve or Bank of England that regulate monetary policy and banking. The Bank of England (1694) was the world's first central bank, created to help the government fund and refinance debt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Commercial Banks</strong>
                <p>Traditional deposit-taking institutions that make loans, subject to regulations limiting their activities to relatively conservative banking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Investment Banks</strong>
                <p>Financial institutions that engage in more complex financial activities like securities underwriting, serving as intermediaries in mergers, and proprietary trading.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Savings and Loans (S&Ls)</strong>
                <p>Specialized institutions designed primarily to accept savings deposits and provide mortgage loans. They were restricted to home mortgage lending for much of their history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Shadow Banks</strong>
                <p>Non-bank financial institutions performing bank-like functions without being subject to traditional banking regulations. Includes money market funds, investment banks, and mortgage originators.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises)</strong>
                <p>Entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that purchase and guarantee mortgages to increase mortgage lending and homeownership.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="regulations" class="section">
            <h2>Key Banking Regulations and Policies</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Glass-Steagall Act (1933)</strong>
                <p>Separated commercial banking from investment banking and established the FDIC. Created as a response to the Great Depression.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)</strong>
                <p>Government entity that guarantees bank deposits (originally up to $40,000, later raised to $100,000). Created to prevent bank runs by assuring depositors their money was safe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Community Reinvestment Act (1977)</strong>
                <p>Required banks to meet the credit needs of their entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Later used as leverage during bank mergers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>GSE Act (1992)</strong>
                <p>Required Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to acquire mortgages originating in targeted urban areas and from low-income borrowers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Dodd-Frank Act</strong>
                <p>Post-2008 crisis legislation aimed at increasing bank regulation. Critics claim it punished small banks that weren't responsible for the crisis while failing to address root causes.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="instruments" class="section">
            <h2>Financial Instruments</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Bills of Exchange</strong>
                <p>Early financial instruments that served as "I promise to pay" notes that could be traded, reducing the need to carry physical money.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Mortgage-Backed Securities</strong>
                <p>Financial instruments created by pooling mortgages which investors can purchase, receiving income from the mortgage payments. Allowed banks to originate more mortgages by selling existing ones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)</strong>
                <p>Complex financial instruments created by packaging different loans (including mortgages) into tranches based on risk levels. Described as "sausages made of sausages."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Subprime Mortgages</strong>
                <p>Loans made to borrowers with poor credit histories. These higher-risk loans typically carry higher interest rates to compensate for increased default risk.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="economic-concepts" class="section">
            <h2>Economic Concepts</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Moral Hazard</strong>
                <p>When entities take greater risks because they don't bear the full consequences. Example: banks making risky loans knowing they're backed by deposit insurance or government bailouts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Too Big to Fail</strong>
                <p>The concept that certain financial institutions are so large and interconnected that their failure would be catastrophic to the economy, necessitating government bailout.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Leverage</strong>
                <p>The ratio of debt to equity or capital. Higher leverage (like the 33:1 ratio of some investment banks or 75:1 for GSEs with guarantees) amplifies both potential profits and losses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Zombie Banks</strong>
                <p>Institutions with negative net worth that continue to operate due to government backing or regulatory forbearance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Liquidity</strong>
                <p>The ability to convert assets to cash quickly without significant loss of value. During crises, liquidity can dry up as institutions hoard cash.</p>

                        <h4>Religious Restrictions</h4>
                        <p>Both Judaism and Christianity restricted usury, but interpreted rules differently. Jews could lend with interest to non-Jews, while Christians were theoretically prohibited from collecting interest from anyone.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>Money Changers</h4>
                        <p>Filled banking roles in ancient Rome, exchanging currencies at a profit. Jesus famously drove them from the temple, reportedly because they had "a rigged exchange rate."</p>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>Jewish Banking Dominance</h4>
                        <p>During the Middle Ages, Jews became Europe's primary bankers, creating resentment that contributed to anti-Semitism. Kings would borrow from Jewish lenders then refuse repayment and expel them.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>Church Banking Practices</h4>
                        <p>The Church prohibited usury while simultaneously profiting from lending. They would "burn all the money lenders or kick them out of town or get them out. And then take over the business kind of on the sly."</p>

                        <p>Found ways to profit from lending while avoiding religious prohibitions, such as taking "discretion" payments rather than interest. Their wealth funded much of the Renaissance.</p>

                        <h4>Government Housing Policy</h4>
                        <p>From the 1930s onward, homeownership was promoted as part of the "American Dream" and as protection against socialism.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</h4>
                        <p>Created to buy mortgages from banks, giving banks more capital to make more loans, thereby stimulating the housing market.</p>

                        <h4>S&L Crisis (1980s)</h4>
                        <p>Inflation and interest rate regulations led S&Ls to pay more for funds than they earned on old mortgages. Deregulation then allowed them to make riskier investments, leading to failures.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>Banking Consolidation</h4>
                        <p>Restrictions on interstate banking were lifted, leading to the creation of "super banks" like Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>CRA and Merger Approval</h4>
                        <p>The Community Reinvestment Act became leverage during bank mergers, with activist groups using the approval process to extract lending commitments from merging banks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <h4>Declining Lending Standards</h4>
                        <p>To meet affordable housing goals, lending standards deteriorated. By the 2000s, mortgages were available with little documentation and minimal down payments.</p>

                        <p>Banks packaged mortgages into securities, selling them to investors. This reduced their risk exposure and allowed them to make more loans.</p>

                <h3>Government-Banking Relationship</h3>
                <p>The transcript portrays this relationship as cyclical and problematic:</p>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Mutually Beneficial but Conflicted</strong>
                    <p>"There's an inherent conflict of interest between a government that is borrowing from a bank and also regulating the bank, and a bank that relies on government help and is also lending to government."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Regulation and Crisis Pattern</strong>
                    <p>Governments impose regulations that create problems, then respond with more regulations that often have unintended consequences.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Political Influence</strong>
                    <p>Banking regulations and enforcement often serve political goals rather than financial stability. "Deeply politicized institutions" like the Federal Reserve bow to political pressure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Blame Shifting</strong>
                    <p>When government policies fail, politicians blame banks: "They come up with programs that they know will fail... And when they fail, they blame somebody else."</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Banking and Society</h3>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Public Perception</strong>
                    <p>Banks have been historically distrusted across cultures and time periods. The transcript quotes a banker saying 40 years ago they had "a pretty good reputation" but today are "a little bit lower than a used car salesman."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Economic Necessity</strong>
                    <p>Despite public distrust, banking serves essential economic functions: "In a free society banks are enormously economically productive because they allocate resources based on economic criteria instead of political criteria."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Risk and Innovation</strong>
                    <p>The documentary argues that periods of loose banking regulation coincide with major technological and economic advances (early 20th century: radio, telephone, automobile) while tight regulation leads to stagnation (Depression to 1960s: "nylon stockings, silly putty, the Frisbee").</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Banking Access Tradeoffs</strong>
                    <p>Strict lending laws historically led to loan sharks and predatory lenders: "When lending laws are too strict and regulations are too strict, the loan sharks proliferate."</p>
